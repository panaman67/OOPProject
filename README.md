OOP class project. This is a WIP

Git Resources:

[simple walkthrough of edit cycle](http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html)

Git Guidelines:

1. **NEVER** commit directly to master, always push to *YOUR* branch and create pull request
2. Nick will merge pull requests, solving any conflicts as necessary
3. Always have a great time, if something goes wrong, we can always revert.... I think...
4. **git push origin :*branch name*** this deletes remote branch. Do ***_NOT_*** do to master, only toyour working branches when done
